# mini-job-board-api
A simplified backend API for a job board application built with Django REST Framework (DRF), featuring JWT authentication, custom permissions, and job filtering.
# Project Overview
This is a Django REST Framework (DRF) backend API designed for a simplified job board application. It allows users to register, obtain JWT tokens, manage their own companies, post jobs linked to their company, and apply to available job listings.Core Objectives AchievedModels: Company, Job, and JobApplication models implemented.Authentication: JWT-based authentication using djangorestframework-simplejwt.API Endpoints: Complete set of required endpoints (/api/register/, /api/token/, /api/companies/, /api/jobs/, /api/jobs/{id}/apply/).Permissions: Custom Object-Level Permissions ensure users can only manage resources they own.
Signals: Django Signals automatically create a default company upon successful user registration.Filtering: Job listings can be filtered by location and company name.Bonus: Prevents duplicate job applications by the same user.⚙️ Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to set up the project locally.1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-job-board-api.git
cd mini-job-board-api
2. Create and Activate Virtual EnvironmentIt is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.Bash# For Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install DependenciesInstall all necessary packages, including DRF, Simple JWT, and Django Filters.Bashpip install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt django-filter
(Alternatively, you can run pip install -r requirements.txt if you create that file.)4. Database SetupApply all migrations to set up the database tables.Bashpython manage.py makemigrations jobs
python manage.py migrate
5. Run the ServerStart the Django development server.Bashpython manage.py runserver
The API root will be accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/🚀 API Usage (Testing with Postman/cURL)All authenticated requests must include the Access Token in the header:Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>1. User Registration (Public)MethodEndpointPayload (JSON)POST/api/register/{"username": "testuser", "email": "a@example.com", "password": "securepassword"}Note: A "Default Company for testuser" is automatically created via a Django Signal upon successful registration.2. Obtain Token (Login)MethodEndpointPayload (JSON)POST/api/token/{"username": "testuser", "password": "securepassword"}Result: Returns access and refresh tokens. Copy the access token for all subsequent authenticated requests.3. Create a Company (Authenticated)MethodEndpointPayload (JSON)POST/api/companies/{"name": "Acme Corp", "description": "Leading tech company"}Requirement: Must include the Access Token. The created_by field is automatically set to the authenticated user.4. Create a Job (Authenticated & Owner Check)The job can only be created if the authenticated user owns the company ID provided.MethodEndpointPayload (JSON)POST/api/jobs/{"title": "Senior Python Dev", "description": "...", "location": "Lahore", "company": 1}Permission Logic: The view ensures request.user is the created_by of Company ID 1 before saving (to prevent IDOR vulnerability).5. List and Filter Jobs (Public Read-Only)MethodEndpointDescriptionGET/api/jobs/Lists all available jobs.GET/api/jobs/?location=LahoreFilters jobs by exact location match.GET/api/jobs/?company_name=AcmeFilters jobs by company name (case-insensitive partial match).6. Apply to a Job (Authenticated)MethodEndpointPayload (JSON)POST/api/jobs/1/apply/{"cover_letter": "I am the best candidate for this role."}Bonus Logic: If the user tries to apply again, the server returns a 400 Bad Request with the message: "You have already applied for this job."
